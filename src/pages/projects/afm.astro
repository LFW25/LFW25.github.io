    <h2>Problem</h2>
    <p>
      Low-temperature scanning probe experiments are unforgiving: you’re balancing mechanical stability,
      thermal constraints, low-noise wiring, and measurement throughput, all while making sure the data
      is interpretable and repeatable. The goal here was not “one-off results,” but a system and workflow
      that behaves predictably and can be extended.
    </p>

  <section class="project-section">
    <h2>What I worked on</h2>
    <ul class="project-bullets">
      <li>
        <strong>Instrument integration:</strong> coordinated cryogenic operation, mechanical constraints,
        electrical feedthroughs, and low-noise measurement requirements into a single practical workflow.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Mechanical design:</strong> CAD modelling, prototyping via 3D printing, producing precision engineering drawings, and recquisitioning custom parts to upgrade the mechanics of the microscope to increase efficiency, reliability, and productivity.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Electrical wiring:</strong> Rewired (almost) the entire microscope to improve strain relief and signal quality, including soldering dozens of wires down to 34 AWG.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>DAQ + control:</strong> built and refined data acquisition/control routines to support stable
        measurement runs (automation where it improves reliability, not just convenience).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Signal quality and reliability:</strong> troubleshooting and iteration focused on reproducible
        signal quality, drift/stability awareness, and “why did this fail?” diagnostics.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Analysis pipelines:</strong> Python-based analysis and visualization used to sanity-check
        measurements quickly and to make iteration cycles faster.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Documentation:</strong> prioritized notes and procedures that make the setup maintainable and
        usable by others (the difference between “it works” and “it’s a system”).
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>System overview</h2>
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Architecture (high level)</h3>
      <ul class="project-bullets">
        <li><strong>Environment:</strong> cryogenic operation (low-temperature constraints drive everything)</li>
        <li><strong>Probe + mechanics:</strong> stability and vibration awareness; careful mechanical choices</li>
        <li><strong>Electronics:</strong> low-noise wiring/grounding mindset; avoid “mystery coupling”</li>
        <li><strong>Acquisition:</strong> DAQ/configuration + scripted routines for repeatability</li>
        <li><strong>Analysis:</strong> fast feedback loop via Python (plots that catch bad runs early)</li>

      On purpose, this page stays at a “systems engineering” level rather than listing sensitive lab details.
      The key message is how the work was approached: stability, noise-awareness, automation for reliability,
      and analysis-driven iteration.

    <h2>Why this matters</h2>
    <p>
      This work is fundamentally about building measurement systems that other people can trust.
      That translates directly to industry R&amp;D: integrating hardware and software, managing constraints,
      debugging real systems, and delivering workflows that are repeatable, documented, and maintainable.
