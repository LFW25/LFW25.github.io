  <h1>Plasma Physics Modeling</h1>

  <h2>Problem</h2>
  <p>
    Non-equilibrium plasma systems exhibit instabilities that can impact both
    experimental results and device performance. Understanding these instabilities
    is critical for predictive modeling in laboratory and applied plasma systems.
  </p>

  <h2>Approach</h2>
  <p>
    I use first-principles kinetic models to simulate plasma behavior, focusing
    on the two-stream instability as a representative case. The goal is to bridge
    theoretical understanding and practical system behavior by producing
    reproducible, high-fidelity simulations.
  </p>

  <h2>Implementation</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Python-based numerical simulation using optimized solvers</li>
    <li>Modular code structure allowing extension to other plasma phenomena</li>
    <li>Visualizations of instability growth and phase-space dynamics</li>
    <li>Hosted on <a href="https://github.com/LFW25/twostream-optimized">GitHub</a> for transparency and reproducibility</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Simulation Preview</h2>
  <p>
    Below is a GIF showing the growth of the two-stream instability over time:

  <h2>Outcome & Next Steps</h2>
  <p>
    This work produces accurate simulations that reproduce expected instability
    behavior and provides a foundation for interactive exploration. Future work
    includes building a web-based interface for real-time parameter manipulation
    and visualization.
