  title: "Plasma Physics Modeling",
  problem: "Non-equilibrium plasma systems exhibit instabilities that can impact both experimental results and device performance. Understanding these instabilities is critical for predictive modeling in laboratory and applied plasma systems.",
  approach: "I use first-principles kinetic models to simulate plasma behavior, focusing on the two-stream instability as a representative case. The goal is to bridge theoretical understanding and practical system behavior with reproducible, high-fidelity simulations.",
  implementation: [
    "Python-based numerical simulation using optimized solvers",
    "Modular code structure allowing extension to other plasma phenomena",
    "Visualizations of instability growth and phase-space dynamics",
    "Hosted on GitHub for transparency and reproducibility (https://github.com/LFW25/twostream-optimized)"
  ],
  gif: "/images/twostream.gif",
  outcome: "Produces accurate simulations that reproduce expected instability behavior. Future work includes building a web-based interface for real-time parameter manipulation and visualization."
