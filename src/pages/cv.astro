    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      I am a research engineer trained as a physicist, with experience spanning experimental
      instrumentation, numerical modeling, and data analysis. I enjoy working on technically
      complex problems where hardware, software, and physical intuition intersect, and where
      reliability and clarity matter as much as raw performance.
    </p>

    <p>
      My background includes building and operating low-temperature experimental systems,
      developing scientific simulations from first principles, and analyzing real-world data
      with appropriate statistical rigor. I am particularly drawn to roles where I can contribute
      to building tools, experiments, or analyses that other people rely on.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="cv-section">
    <h2>Technical Focus</h2>
    <p>
      My work is grounded in applied physics and research engineering. During my MSc, I focused on
      low-temperature atomic force microscopy (AFM) instrumentation for silicon nanodevices,
      gaining hands-on experience with experimental hardware, data acquisition, and measurement
      workflows in cryogenic environments.
    </p>

    <p>
      In parallel, I maintain a strong interest in scientific computing and modeling. I routinely
      use Python-based workflows for simulation, data analysis, and visualization, and I am
      comfortable designing custom numerical tools when off-the-shelf solutions are insufficient.
      Recent projects include stochastic simulations of crystallisation processes, modeling of
      plasma instabilities, and survey-weighted statistical analysis.

    <h2>Selected Experience</h2>

    <div class="cv-item">
      <h3>MSc Research — Low-Temperature AFM Instrumentation</h3>
      <p class="cv-meta">McGill University · 2023–2025</p>
      <p>
        As part of my master’s research, I worked on the development and refinement of
        low-temperature AFM instrumentation for characterizing silicon nanodevices. This involved
        integrating experimental hardware with data acquisition and analysis pipelines, debugging
        measurement issues, and iterating on protocols to improve reliability and signal quality.
      </p>
      <p>
        The work emphasized careful experimental design, documentation, and reproducibility — with
        the goal of building measurement systems that others can trust and extend.

      <h3>Undergraduate Research — Lanthanide-Doped Microcrystals</h3>
      <p class="cv-meta">Optical materials collaboration · Early undergraduate (2nd year)</p>
      <p>
        I contributed to an experimental study of lanthanide-doped Y₂SiO₅ microcrystals, focusing
        on optical characterization and analysis. This project resulted in a peer-reviewed
        publication on which I am a second author.
      </p>
      <p>
        This experience provided early exposure to collaborative research, experimental planning,
        data interpretation, and publication-oriented technical writing.

    <h2>Computational & Data Work</h2>
    <p>
      Alongside experimental research, I have substantial experience with computational and
      data-driven work. I build simulations and analysis pipelines primarily in Python, using
      numerical and scientific libraries to explore physical systems and real-world datasets.
    </p>

    <p>
      This includes Monte Carlo simulations of non-equilibrium systems, numerical modeling of
      plasma instabilities, and statistically rigorous analysis of large-scale survey data,
      including weighted sampling and regression across demographic variables.

  <section class="cv-section">
    <h2>Leadership & Volunteering</h2>
    <p>
      I have been deeply involved in volunteer and service roles throughout my graduate studies,
      particularly in areas related to equity, governance, and the culture of scientific work.
      These roles have been an important part of how I think about leadership and responsibility
      in technical environments.
    </p>

    <p>
      I served as an Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (EDI) Officer for the McGill Graduate Physics
      Student Society, where I worked with other student leaders and faculty to support inclusive
      practices, improve communication, and advocate for underrepresented students. This role
      required navigating complex interpersonal and institutional dynamics while remaining
      pragmatic and solutions-focused.
    </p>

    <p>
      In addition, I contributed to the Physics Department’s EDI Committee and served as a
      representative on the McGill Faculty of Science Council, gaining experience in formal
      governance, consensus-building, and long-term policy discussions. I have also helped
      organize the Physics and Ethics Committee, which created space for discussions about the
      societal impacts and responsibilities of scientific work.
    </p>

    <p>
      Through these roles, I developed skills in communication, coordination, and leadership that
      complement my technical background and are directly transferable to collaborative industry
      environments.
