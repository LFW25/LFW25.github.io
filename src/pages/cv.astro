  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    I am driven by curiosity and by the process of finding patterns in complex systems.
    I love working with data — understanding where it comes from, what it can (and cannot)
    tell us, and how careful analysis can turn uncertainty into insight.
  </p>

  <p>
    At the same time, I care deeply about people and about building things that are useful
    to others. Much of my work has involved creating tools, experiments, or analyses that
    other people rely on, whether that is an experimental instrument, a data pipeline, or
    a shared research workflow.
  </p>

  <p>
    I am a lifelong learner who genuinely enjoys not knowing things at first.
    I like asking questions, following them through technical detail, and learning new
    domains well enough to contribute meaningfully. This has led me to work across physics,
    engineering, data analysis, and governance, and I am comfortable moving between fields
    when the problem demands it.
  </p>

  <p>
    I am looking for roles where curiosity, thoughtful problem-solving, and collaboration
    are valued — and where there is room to keep learning while building systems that matter.

      <p class="cv-meta">McGill University · Montréal, QC · 2023–Present</p>
      <p>
        Designed, built, and operated custom low-temperature atomic force microscopy (AFM)
        systems for semiconductor and nanodevice characterization. This work involved integrating
        cryogenic cooling, vacuum systems, electrical feedthroughs, and low-noise signal wiring to
        achieve reliable operation below 10 K.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was responsible for hands-on assembly, troubleshooting, calibration, and system
        documentation, with an emphasis on reproducibility and long-term maintainability.

    <h2>Leadership & Volunteering</h2>
    <p>
      I have been actively involved in volunteer leadership and governance roles throughout my
      graduate studies, particularly in areas related to equity, departmental culture, and
      responsible scientific practice.
    </p>

    <p>
      I served as an Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (EDI) Officer for the McGill Graduate Physics
      Student Society, working with students and faculty to support inclusive practices, improve
      communication, and advocate for underrepresented groups. This role required balancing
      interpersonal sensitivity with practical, systems-level thinking.
    </p>

    <p>
      I also served on the Physics Department EDI Committee and as a representative on the McGill
      Faculty of Science Council, gaining experience with formal governance, consensus-building,
      and long-term institutional decision-making. Additionally, I helped organize the Physics and
      Ethics Committee, which facilitated discussions on the societal responsibilities of
      scientific work.
