  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    I am driven by curiosity and by the process of finding patterns in complex systems.
    I love working with data — understanding where it comes from, what it can (and cannot)
    tell us, and how careful analysis can turn uncertainty into insight.
  </p>

  <p>
    At the same time, I care deeply about people and about building things that are useful
    to others. Much of my work has involved creating tools, experiments, or analyses that
    other people rely on, whether that is an experimental instrument, a data pipeline, or
    a shared research workflow.
  </p>

  <p>
    I am a lifelong learner who genuinely enjoys not knowing things at first.
    I like asking questions, following them through technical detail, and learning new
    domains well enough to contribute meaningfully. This has led me to work across physics,
    engineering, data analysis, and governance, and I am comfortable moving between fields
    when the problem demands it.
  </p>

  <p>
    I am looking for roles where curiosity, thoughtful problem-solving, and collaboration
    are valued — and where there is room to keep learning while building systems that matter.

    <h2>Leadership & Volunteering</h2>
    <p>
      I have been actively involved in volunteer leadership and governance roles throughout my
      life and graduate studies, particularly in areas related to equity, departmental culture, and
      responsible scientific practice.
    </p>

    <p>
      I served as an <strong>Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (EDI) Officer</strong> for the McGill Graduate Physics
      Student Society, working with students and faculty to support inclusive practices, improve
      communication, and advocate for underrepresented groups. This role required balancing
      interpersonal sensitivity with practical, systems-level thinking. I helped organize and facilitate the <strong>Physics and
      Ethics Committee</strong>, which hosted discussions on the societal responsibilities of
      scientific work.
    </p>

    <p>
      I also served on the <strong>Physics Department EDI Committee</strong> and as a representative on the McGill
      <strong>Faculty of Science Council</strong>, gaining experience with formal governance, consensus-building,
      and long-term institutional decision-making. Additionally, I served on three different <strong>McGill executive search committees</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      During my graduate degree, I volunteered at local elementary schools to teach young girls science by helping them build telescopes in Minecraft, through <strong>McGill's Science in Space program</strong> sponsored by Dell. I also was regularly involved in organising and running <strong>public lectures</strong>, various <strong>department open days</strong>, and was an event organiser and mentor at the <strong>McGill Physics Hackathons</strong> in 2023 and 2024. In my undergraduate degree, I volunteered as an <strong>educator at public science outreach events</strong>, including local science fairs and festivals at which my university had a presence. I organised and taught a dozen <strong>radiation education workshops</strong> for local high school students, which included handling of real (used) uranium fuel rods from the university's old test reactor. I have also done volunteer work in non-education-related areas, such as at <strong>COVID vaccine clinics</strong> during the pandemic, where I helped comfort nervous patients and organise the hundreds of visitors each hour; in a similar vein, I was a <strong>care-package delivery driver</strong>, dropping around medical and food care packages to students at the university who got sick and didn't have strong support networks.
    </p>
    <p>
      I truly love helping people, and I hope to continue volunteering throughout my life.
